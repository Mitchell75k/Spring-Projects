I literally have spent 3 hours trying to figure out what is wrong with my Jakarta validation constraints to avail. If I can't be granted a pass for my test, please let me know what 
is wrong with it, I would really appreciate it. Thank you. 

Problem: Error messages are not being displayed when the user inputs an invalid values that go against Jakarta validation constraints.
Suspected culprit: Since no Jakarta validation constraints are not being displayed, maybe my dependencies are not correct in my pom.xml file?
